Beginner HTML Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my beginner HTML projects! As I start my web development journey, I'm excited to share the projects I’ve built to practice and demonstrate key HTML concepts.

Projects Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects created while learning HTML. Each project showcases a different aspect of web development, from building forms to structuring complete web pages.

Projects Included
Survey Form
An interactive form that collects user input using text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a submit button, demonstrating the use of various HTML form elements.

Tribute Page
A web page dedicated to honoring a person or subject, complete with images and informative content, focusing on basic HTML structure and semantic elements.

Technical Documentation Page
A structured page that provides documentation for a technical subject, featuring headings, paragraphs, and navigation links to simulate a real technical manual.

Product Landing Page
A landing page designed to showcase a product or service, including sections for promotional content, embedded multimedia, and a call-to-action button.

Personal Portfolio Page
A simple, yet professional page to introduce myself and display my work, featuring a project showcase, contact information, and links to my social profiles.
